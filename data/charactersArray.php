Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged - throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge. As once described by his seargent: He loves putting away bad guys and solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.",

Because of how much she values rules and authority, Amy upholds an unnaturally high amount of respect towards superior officers, particularly Captain Holt. This causes her to be desperate for her captain's wisdom and approval, often to the point of coming off as awkward and off-putting.",

Though he is often made fun of by his colleagues for his lack of displaying emotion, he is held in the highest regard by them and has developed close relationships with most of them.",
