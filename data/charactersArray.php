        'description' => "Peralta is a cop that has never been one to follow the rules too closely. Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged - throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge. As once described by his seargent: He loves putting away bad guys and solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.",

Because of how much she values rules and authority, Amy upholds an unnaturally high amount of respect towards superior officers, particularly Captain Holt. This causes her to be desperate for her captain's wisdom and approval, often to the point of coming off as awkward and off-putting.",

Inwardly, he is a warm, empathetic, devoted, and kind-hearted man who cares deeply about the officers and employees under his command. Though he is often made fun of by his colleagues for his lack of displaying emotion, he is held in the highest regard by them and has developed close relationships with most of them.",

Terry has a tendancy to talk about himself in third person, which he is often made fun of, but he has no intention to stop. If there is anything Seargent Jeffords cares more about that his squad, his family.Terry's twin daughters are the most important in his life, and also yoghurt. Terry loves yoghurt.",

He is a hopeless romantic, that is not afraid to share details that others would keep to themselves and often make dirty references without being aware of it himself. Charles is Jake's best friend and they always want to work cases together. Charles is also a huge foodie!",

Most of the members of the precinct are frightened by her. She takes pride in the fact that no one knows much about her. Jake only knows three facts about her, one of which is that she won't let people crash at her place, despite the fact that Rosa refers to him as her closest friend. In 99,",
