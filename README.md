# Brooklyn Nine Nine

Text about the project and why it exists. This would also be a great place to link the project on One.com.

# Installation

There are 2 major content pages of the site, the **characters-page** and the **quiz-page**.
We can navigate to the pages using either the header or the frame on the landing page.

On the **characters-page** we can go to learn about the six main characters, the site will always load their info cards in a different order.
The names of the actors are also links to their IMDB.com pages, and if hovered shows some short info about the actor.
Now that we have refreshed our memories of the characters in the show we can take the **quiz**.
The quiz gives us three options to every question, one is always right. When we submit our answers we will be directed to the results page where we can see how many points we got and be evaluated.
